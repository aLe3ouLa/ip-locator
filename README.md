# IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I am using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I am using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

The users are able to:

[x] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
[] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
[x] See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
[x] Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

Technologies:

[x] React.js
[x] Styled components
[x] IPify
[x] LeafletJS
